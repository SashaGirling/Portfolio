# Portfolio
A sample of my project work using SQL, Tableau, Python and libraries Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-Learn and more. 


#### Player Retention and Churn (SQL, Excel) 
[Project overview](https://github.com/SashaGirling/Retenetion-and-Churn-SQL-/blob/933c3cb90dd255f056ad3c6d93e871257abdc2f1/README.md) [Queries](https://github.com/SashaGirling/Retenetion-and-Churn-SQL-/blob/main/queries.txt.txt)\
●	In BigQuery I utilized my SQL skills to draw insights from a relational database regarding game player registration, retention and churn. I then aggregated the data through Pivot tables in Excel and created visualizations.

#### Food Consumption Trends (Tableau)
●	An analysis and visualization in Tableau that demonstrates how data can be aggregated and presented in multiple ways to develop opposing stories.

#### Customer Profile Analysis (Python: Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, statsmodels)
●	Utilized Python and libraries to explore, clean and analyze a customer behaviour dataset through predictive modeling and correlation analysis. 

#### Social Media Marketing Analysis (Tableau, Python: NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Seaborn)
●	Utilized Python and multiple libraries to undertake analysis and data cleaning of social media ad campaign dataset to recommend targeting using linear regression and correlation. I also created a Tableau story that included interactive graphs and calculated fields to visualize metrics and recommendations.
