# Portfolio
A sample of my project work using SQL, Tableau, Python and libraries Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-Learn and more. 


#### Player Retention and Churn (SQL, Excel) 
●	In BigQuery I utilized my SQL skills to draw insights from a relational database regarding game player registration, retention and churn. I then aggregated the data through Pivot tables in Excel and created visualizations. <br>

#### Social Media Marketing Analysis (Tableau, Python: NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Seaborn)
●	Utilized Python and multiple libraries to undertake analysis and data cleaning of social media ad campaign dataset to recommend targeting using linear regression and correlation. I also created a Tableau story that included interactive graphs and calculated fields to visualize metrics and recommendations.
